<h2>About Me - <a href="./pdf/cv.pdf">CV</a></h2>

<p> Since July 1st 2020, I'm an assistant professor at the
  University of Maryland, College Park and a proud member of
  the <a href="http://plum-umd.github.io/">PLUM lab</a>.  My research uses
  programming language abstractions to make it easier to write, debug,
  and reason about software and their specifications, with a
  particular focus on random testing, formal verification, and their
  interplay. If you share the same interests, send me an e-mail!
